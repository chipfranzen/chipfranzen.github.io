I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with interests in Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Visualization. I've worked mostly with open source data science tools through Python, R, and SQLite, but hava some experience with licensed software like GraphLab Create.

My interests outside of Data Science are varied, but I am looking to build tools and find insights to help derive actionable intelligence from data. I'm interested in web development, public policy, education, finance, language, and music. My experience as a Peace Corps volunteer in Madagascar was formative, and I'd like to continue to serve the public interest in some capacity.
