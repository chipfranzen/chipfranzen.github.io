I'm Data Scientist with interests in Machine Learning and Statistics, in particular Bayesian modeling, stochastic processes, and deep learning. I've worked mostly with open source data science tools through Python, R, and PostgreSQL. I also have experience using Spark and writing MapReduce jobs. I've also spent some time studying Scala.

My interests outside of Data Science are varied, but I am looking to build tools and find insights to help derive actionable intelligence from data. I'm interested in public policy, education, finance, language, and music. My experience as a Peace Corps volunteer in Madagascar was formative, and I'd like to continue to serve the public interest in some capacity.
