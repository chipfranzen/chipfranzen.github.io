    "This is a text summarizer based loosely on [SMMRY](http://smmry.com/). It returns the most important sentences in a document. It works by assigning a score to each sentence in one of 2 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. summing the tf-idf values of its constituent words OR\n",
    "\n",
    "2. calculating the distance of each sentence from all the other sentences.\n",

    "Sentences are then ranked and the top-scoring ones are returned in chronological order."

      "Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child.Once she gave her a little riding hood of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called 'Little Red Riding Hood.\n",
      "'Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don't forget to say, \"Good morning\", and don't peep into every corner before you do it.\n",
      "'The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her.Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\n",
      "'Thank you kindly, wolf.\n",
      "''To my grandmother's.\n",
      "''What have you got in your apron?\n",
      "''Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\n",
      "''A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,' replied Little Red Riding Hood.The wolf thought to himself: 'What a tender young creature!what a nice plump mouthful - she will be better to eat than the old woman.I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\n",
      "'So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said: 'See, Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here - why do you not look round?I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.\n",
      "'It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time.\n",
      "'So she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door.\n",
      "'Who is there?\n",
      "''She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.\n",
      "''Lift the latch,' called out the grandmother, 'I am too weak, and cannot get up.\n",
      "'The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her.Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: 'Oh dear!how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.\n",
      "'She called out: 'Good morning,' but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n",
      "'Oh!grandmother,' she said, 'what big ears you have!\n",
      "''All the better to hear you with, my child,' was the reply.\n",
      "'But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!\n",
      "''All the better to see you with, my dear.\n",
      "''But, grandmother, what large hands you have!\n",
      "''All the better to hug you with.\n",
      "'but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!\n",
      "''All the better to eat you with!\n",
      "'The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: 'How the old woman is snoring!I must just see if she wants anything.\n",
      "''Do I find you here, you old sinner!\n",
      "''I have long sought you!\n",
      "'But just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.When he had made two snips, he saw the little red riding hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: 'Ah, how frightened I have been!After that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe.Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.Then all three were delighted.\n",
      "'Well,' said the grandmother, 'we will shut the door, so that he can not come in.\n",
      "'But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red Riding Hood went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness.But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child: 'Take the pail, Red Riding Hood; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.\n",

    "Even with one third removed, the story is fairly easy to follow. The summarizer dealt best with exposition and narration and all the major plot-points are covered. The summarizer doesn't do so well with dialogue, however, which makes sense, since deleting any portion of a dialogue interrupts the flow of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf-idf sum method is heavily biased towards long sentences. I tried to temper this by assigning the *average* tf-idf as the score instead of the sum, but this led to a summary comprised almost entirely of short bits of disconnected dialogue. Distance methods are a bit shorter, but not much. Different distances return very different summaries, so this is one way to tune the method to specific types of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMMRY mentions that it removes unnecessary clauses. Incorporating something like this could also substantially shorten the final summary. One final idea for further improvement is automating the amount of material that is returned. This seems like it might be quite difficult, since a human is needed to evaluate the quality of the summary."
